times than we can count, beef Wellington's origins are as unclear as its connection to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Traditionally, it's a beef fillet steak, coated in pâté and mushroom duxelles (an extremely finely chopped mixture of mushrooms, shallots and herbs), wrapped in puff pastry, then baked. Its modern-day popularity is largely thanks to Gordon Ramsay who's made it one of his signature dishes.","details":[{"Cuisine":"British"},{"Recipe Type":"Beef"},{"Difficulty":"Medium"},{"Preparation Time":"50 mins"},{"Cooking Time":"45 mins"},{"Serves":"8"}],"ingredients":["1.5 kg beef fillet, trimmed and tied","2 tbsp sunflower oil","45 g butter","1 small onion, chopped","250 g flat mushrooms, finely chopped","175 g smooth liver pâté","400 g ready-made puff pastry","1 egg, beaten","1 pinch salt and black pepper"],"recipe":["Season the beef with black pepper.
