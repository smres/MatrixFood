All we know is that it's an incredibly tasty and filling dish that's become a popular breakfast and brunch meal throughout the world. Literally translating as a mixture, it's usually cooked by reducing down tomatoes, onions and a range of spices before the eggs are poached on top.","details":[{"Cuisine":"Middle Eastern"},{"Recipe Type":"Eggs"},{"Difficulty":"Easy"},{"Preparation Time":"20 mins"},{"Cooking Time":"5 mins"},{"Serves":"6"}],"ingredients":["0.5 tsp salt","0.5 tsp black pepper","0.5 tsp cumin (optional)","6 large eggs","100 g feta cheese, roughly chopped","8 large tomatoes on the vine, chopped","125 ml tomato juice","2 large aubergines, sliced into rounds","0.5 red onion","1 garlic clove, finely chopped","3 tbsp olive oil, for frying"],"recipe":["Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7.","Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan.
