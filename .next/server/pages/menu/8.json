Consisting of beef slowly braised in red wine, plus beef stock, carrots, onions and sometimes mushrooms, this super-rich dish is packed with layers of flavour. It's also become one of the most famous recipes from Julia Child's groundbreaking cookbook The French Chef.","details":[{"Cuisine":"French"},{"Recipe Type":"Main"},{"Difficulty":"Medium"},{"Preparation Time":"200 mins"},{"Cooking Time":"135 mins"},{"Serves":"4"}],"ingredients":["800 g Beef brisket, cut into large cubes","1 l Full-bodied red wine","2 Thyme sprigs","4 Garlic cloves, crushed with the flat edge of a knife or your hand","3 tbsp Cognac","100 ml Sunflower oil","2 tbsp Plain flour","600 ml Veal stock or chicken stock","2 Carrots, peeled, halved lengthways and cut into chunks","12 Silverskin onions","100 g Small button mushrooms","100 g Pancetta, diced","1 handful Flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped","1 pinch Salt","1 pinch Freshly ground black pepper","1 Bouquet garni (made with 1 parsley sprig, 1 thyme sprig and 1 small bay leaf)"],"recipe":["In a deep dish, mix together the beef, wine, thyme, garlic and Cognac. Cover with cling film and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 3 hours.","Drain the meat into a bowl, using a colander, and reserve the marinade.","Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan or cast iron pot over a medium hear. Add the meat and cook for 20 minutes until brown, season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with the flour and cook, stirring, for a further 2-3 minutes.","Add the stock and reserved marinade and bring to the boil. Skim the foam off the surface and add the bouquet garni, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender.

Add the carrots and onions and cook for 10 minutes or until soft and pale gold in colour, then add to the meat saucepan.","When the beef is almost ready, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the mushrooms and pancetta and fry 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, then add them to the beef.
