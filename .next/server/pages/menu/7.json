{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":7,"name":"Cacio e pepe","price":20,"discount":0,"introduction":"There are countless divine Italian pasta recipes, but this one is genius in its simplicity. Translating as cheese and pepper, the dish, as its name suggests, uses a handful of basic ingredients: black pepper, cheese, pasta and butter. You'll find versions made with either spaghetti, linguine or pici, which is a short, thick worm-like pasta, and there's also debate about what cheese to use – it's usually either Parmesan or pecorino romano.","details":[{"Cuisine":"Italian"},{"Recipe Type":"Pasta"},{"Difficulty":"Easy"},{"Preparation Time":"5 mins"},{"Cooking Time":"10 mins"},{"Serves":"2"}],"ingredients":["200 g spaghetti or linguine","1 pinch sea salt, for the cooking water","1 large knob of butter","1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, plus extra to serve","60 g Parmesan or pecorino or a mixture (or a vegetarian alternative), finely grated, plus extra to serve"],"recipe":["Cook the pasta in a saucepan of boiling, salted water for 6–8 minutes, or until it is not quite tender and still has some bite remaining. Drain and reserve the pasta water.","Quickly return the pan to a medium-high heat.
